Q.What is a lightning conductor ? What its uses. 
ANSWER :--- A lightning is a thick copper wire as well as a strip tied towards the maximum height of a structure to a lengthy copper eart pole hammering down into the ground somewhere at the building's side.                                                                  
USES OF LIGHTNING CONDUCTOR  :--   
*It protects structures against lightning strikes by allowing the ground instead of through the building.       
* This same current in the conductor is so high that it melts or vaporizes the metal, however, the harm to the building would be minimal.

Q. If there is a lightning conductor what may be its symbol ?    
ANSWER :-- Lightning conductor is the device which protects humans and more valuable things from lightning. To install a lightning conductor, a metal rod is fitted inside a building during construction. While one end of the conductor is buried inside the ground, the other end emerges out from the roof. The lightning conductor provides a path for heavy electric charge (present in lightning) to discharge to the ground, without causing any harm to the building as well as  inhabitants.                                                                                                      
There is no such symbols assigned to lightning conductors we normally represent it by drawing a thin metallic rod with fins on its base.
